This is simple lightweight library written in Kotlin to manage and validates polish identification numbers like: NIP, PESEL, REGON (9-digit and 14-digit).

## Purpose of project
It is easier to maintain validators and other utilities functions as one additional library instead of coppy&pase the same code between projects.

```

Step 2. Add the dependency
```gradle

}
